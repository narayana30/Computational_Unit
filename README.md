Developed a high-performance Computational Unit (CU) from transistor-level circuits with the help of industry-standard tools LTSPICE and Electric.
From the ground up, designed and optimized circuits at the transistor level, executing a wide range of arithmetic and logical operations.
Set-up the integration of Arithmetical and Logical Units within the Computational Unit, establishing a unified input interface to streamline data processing.
Conducted testing and validation of the ALU design, and analyzed circuit behaviour, identified potential issues, and refined the design for better performance.
